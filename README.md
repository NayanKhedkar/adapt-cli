Adapt Command Line Interface
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adaptlearning/adapt-cli.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adaptlearning/adapt-cli)

Installation
------------

To install the Adapt CLI, first be sure to install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), then from the command line run:-


        npm install -g adapt-cli


Usage
-----

##### Creating an Adapt course

    adapt create {type} {path} [{branch}]

type - What to create. Only the value "course" is currently supported. 
path - The directory of the new course.
branch - Optional - The branch of the framework to be downloaded.

For example...

    adapt create course "My Course"

This will download the Adapt framework and create an new course in the directory "My Course", in your current directory.

##### Creating an Adapt component

    adapt create component {name} [{branch}]

name - The name of the new component.
branch - Optional - The branch of the component template to be downloaded. The default is master.

If you run this in an existing course, the component will be created in the `src/components` directory. Otherwise it will be created in the current directory.

##### Searching for an Adapt plugin.

    adapt search {name or partial name of plugin to search for}


##### Installing a plugin into your current directory

    adapt install {name of plugin}

Additionally you can install a specific version of a plugin.

    adapt install {name of plugin}#{version}

Anywhere that you are required to provide a name of a plugin it can be either fully qualified with 'adapt-' or optionally you can omit the prefix an just use the plugin name.

Therefore these commands are equivalent:

    adapt install adapt-my-plugin
    adapt install my-plugin

Installed plugins are saved to `adapt.json`. 

##### Installing plugins previously saved in adapt.json

    adapt install


##### Uninstalling a plugin from your current directory

    adapt uninstall {name of plugin}


The Plugin Registry
-------------------

The plugin system is powered by [Bower](http://bower.io/). Each plugin should be a valid bower package and they should be registered with the Adapt registry.

    http://adapt-bower-repository.herokuapp.com/packages/

See [Developing plugins](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Developing-plugins) for more information on defining your plugins package.

##### Registering a plugin

From within a plugin directory

    adapt register

`name` and `repository` will be read from `bower.json` in the current directory.

The package will be registered with the registry on a first come first serve basis.
